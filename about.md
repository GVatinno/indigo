Known as GV or ジーヴィー; I am an easygoing human, orginally from Italy, took home in this world across Italy, UK, Ireland and Sweden.

Educated in Computer Science hold a M.sc in Computer science and an M.sc in Interactive Entertaiment Technologies.

Built my career around real time programming and creative projects with more than a decade of industry experience. Worked in different fields from banking to movies visual effects and untilmately settled in the videogame industry.

Very friendly, my favourite food is Italian, followed by japanese!
My intetrests span across the spectrum from surfing, to cooking; music, videogames and movies of course.  
Love sea, love sun, love people, love travel, love life.

Thanks for your intrest!

When they ask me what I do:  
> *Programming is like playing with LEGO with infinite piecies; it is awesome, just sometimes you will step barefoot on those piecies.*

> *Programming videogames is like playing with LEGO in a lego shop with licence to play everything; it is fantastic, at times it might look more walking barefoot on LEGO and blindfolded, but if you have the right team it is the best experience in the world!.*

*Gv, ジーヴィー*
